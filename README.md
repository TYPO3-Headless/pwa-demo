## nuxt-typo3 development together with TYPO3 PWA Demo API

This ddev repository provides working application in production mode.
To play with sources of [nuxt-typo3](https://github.com/TYPO3-Initiatives/nuxt-typo3) plugin based on API created by this ddev package just:

1. Clone [nuxt-typo3](https://github.com/TYPO3-Initiatives/nuxt-typo3) inside of this repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TYPO3-Initiatives/nuxt-typo3.git
   ```
2. Go to nuxt-typo3 directory and install all needed packages
    ```bash
    cd nuxt-typo3 && yarn install
    ```
3. Inside of nuxt-typo3 directory call `yarn link` - this command create a symlink for sources of nuxt-typo3 (https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/link/)
    ```bash
    yarn link
    ```
4. Go to `front` directory and call
    ```bash
    yarn link "nuxt-typo3"
    ```
5. Change `nuxt.config.js` in `front` directory
   ```js
    typo3: {
        ...
        api: {
            baseURL: 'http://api.pwa-demo.ddev.site'
        },
        ...
    }
    ```
6. Call `yarn dev` inside of `front` directory
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```
7. Make some changes in `nuxt-typo3` directory - your front app should be triggered and rebuilded with new changes in `nuxt-typo3` sources.
